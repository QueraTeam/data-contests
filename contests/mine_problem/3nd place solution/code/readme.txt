for using prediction you must run predict.py and all images must be existed in data folder like:
 data/test-rqd/xxxx.jpg
 data/from-to-rqd.xlsx is necessary too

for training you must run RCNN.py please use a descent PC (win32 platform has been test)
on linux or macos error may emerge. data folders are like:

1 - make trainA folder in data
2 - run auto_label.py
3 - copy train images to trainA
4 - run RCNN.py

data/trainA which you have to copy training image in that before running script
data/label.xlsx
data/labelA.xlsx its generated by auto_label.py
