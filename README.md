# Solutions of Quera Data Contests

At Quera's Data Science & Machine Learning team, we organize data contests where students or anyone who is interested in data and programming can participate, learn by doing, win prizes, and get job interview offers from our sponsering companies.

To help the participants and provide them with proper educaitonal resources for the contests, we share the solutions of the top 3 winners of each data contest and the files we discuss in the post-contest webinar. Therefore, one can learn from them and probably have a better performance in our next data contest :blush:.
